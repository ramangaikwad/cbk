A 38 year old man presented with a 2 month history of weight loss and generalised weakness. He reported low grade fever, dry cough and shortness of breath since 10 days. Examination revealed tachycardia, tachypnea, and bilateral rales on chest auscultation. Multiple non-tender cervical nodes were present. Pulse oximetry showed a oxygen saturation of 85% while breathing ambient room air. The chest radiograph showed few ill defined infiltrates in the lower lung fields.

HIV ELISA was positive for antibodies to HIV-I. CT scan of the chest showed bilateral extensive ground glassing. An induced sputum was negative for pneumocystis by Gomori methenamine stain. Aspiration of the cervical node showed numerous acid fast bacilli on the ZN smear. Xpert MTB RIF was positive (with no rifampicin resistance) on the lymph node aspirate. The sputum AFB smear and Xpert MTB RIF were negative. The CD4 count was 28 cells/μl. The HIV-I viral load was 27,000 copies/ml.

The patient’s course was marked worsening of tachypnea and oxygenation in the second week of treatment. Intercurrent drug-induced hepatitis developed and the ATT regimen was switched to levofloxacin, ethambutol, and streptomycin. Trimethoprim associated hyperkalemia was managed with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued after 3 weeks of treatment.
