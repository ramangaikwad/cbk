**Brouwer, A. E. et al. Combination antifungal therapies for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: a randomised trial. Lancet 363, 1764–1767 (2004).** [Pubmed] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172774)

Four regimens compared: AmB alone / AmB+5FC / AmB+Flu / AmB+Flu+5FC
Primary endpoint was fungicidal activity measured by the rate of decline of CSF cryptococcal CFU at days 3, 7, and 14.
0.54 log reduction in Cryptococcal CFU / day for AmB+5FC compared to 0.31 log reduction for AmB alone.  0.36 log reduction with the triple combination. Increased risk of death associated with cerebral dysfunction (seizure/coma) and initially high cryptococcal CSF CFU/ml

Three regimens compared: AmB\*4w/ AmB+5FC\*2w / AmB+Flu\*2w
Fewer deaths with AmB+5FC at 14 and 70 days. No benefit of AmB+Flu combination on survival.
AmB+5FC: increased rates of yeast clearance -0.42CFU/ml/d vs -0.31(AmB) & -0.32(AmB+Flu)

Early ART (within 72 hours) (28 patients) vs Delayed ART (after 10 weeks of treatment with fluconazole alone) (26 patients)
Higher 3 year mortality (88% vs 54%) in early ART group. Study terminated early by data monitoring committee

**Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis for cryptococcal meningitis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy: a prospective, multicenter, randomized study** [Pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12746781)

60 patients randomised to discontinuation (n=20) vs continuation(n=22) of fluconazole after CD4 count increased above 100 cells/ul
Durint the median 48 week followup period there were no cases of cryptococcal meningitis in either group
