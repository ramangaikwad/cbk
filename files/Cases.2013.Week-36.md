HIV ELISA test was negative. Toxoplasma IgM was negative. Chest radiograph was normal. Cervical lymph node aspirate revealed granulomatous inflammation. AFB stains were negative. Xpert MTB RIF revealed presence of mycobacterial DNA and presence of rifampicin resistance mutations. Line probe assays on lymph node aspirate revealed isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and quinolone resistance.

An empirical second line regimen with ethionamide, cycloserine, PAS, linezolid and kanamycin was started. Mycobacterial cultures of lymph node aspirate were positive after 3 weeks of incubation.
