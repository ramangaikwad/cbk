#### 55 year old man with acute abdomen

55 year old man with no previous illnesses presented with acute onset severe abdominal pain. Examination revealed a tender rigid abdomen. The complete blood count revealed leucocytosis. A CT abdomen with contrast revealed an aortic thrombus with a aortic pseudoaneurysm near the aortic bifurcation with a mural mass in the caecum. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, resection of left gangrenous bowel with resection of the aneurysm with a prosthetic aortic graft. Postoperative recovery was uneventful.

Blood culture drawn at admission and cultures from the aortic pseudoaneurysm grew Clostridium septicum. Endoscopic biopsy of the caecal mass showed colonic adenocarcinoma. The patient was started on a 4 week regimen of intravenous piperacillin tazobactam.

#### 16 year old male with fever and altered sensorium

A 16 year old boy from Tamil Nadu was admitted with fever, altered sensorium and generalised clonic tonic seizures since 3 days. On examination, the neck was stiff with a GCS score of 4. Both pupils were sluggishly reactive to light. On admission, he underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Blood smears were negative for malarial parasites. An MRI of the brain showed severe cerebral edema, with basal ganglionic and thalamic hyperintensities  but no evidence of tentorial or uncal herniation.

A deferred CSF analysis revealed a protein of 72 mg/dl, leukocyte count of 170 cells/Î¼l with 95% neutrophils and glucose of 65 mg/dl. CSF HSV PCR was negative. An initial dengue serology was non-reactive. However D8 dengue serology was positive for IgG and IgM antibodies. The result of a CSF Japanese Encephalitis IgM assay was positive.

The patient recovered slowly over the hospital stay with severe residual neurologic sequelae. Hospital stay was complicated by hospital acquired pneumonia caused by ESBL producing  E coli. The positive dengue serology in the blood was thought to represent an anamnestic response. Japanese encephalitis was diagnosed in view of consistent clinical and radiologic findings with a positive CSF IgM assay.
